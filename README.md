# Resource Management Messaging Platform

This is a messaging system to provide secure resource management communication infrastructure for interoperable communications between a heterogenous collection of resource messaging systems. 

The system expects messages to follow the EDXL-RM standard: https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#edxlrm-v1.0
However, the system serves as a tranlsation engine between systems which do not follow the standard and aims to aide communication between systems which do not currently communicate.

We have several small actors (clients) to demonstrate the capability of the system.

This project was created at Louisiana State University in Fall 2018 for CSC 4304: Systems Programming II.
